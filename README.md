# Responsive Login System with Email Confirmation and Validation

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a modern, responsive login system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. It includes all the essential features of a secure login process, such as **email validation**, **password strength checking**, **"Remember me" functionality**, and **email confirmation** for new users. The system is fully functional and incorporates both front-end and back-end technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The login page adapts to any screen size, ensuring an optimal experience on mobile devices and desktops.
- **Email Validation**: The system performs real-time email validation to ensure users provide valid email addresses.
- **Password Validation**: The login form checks for non-empty password fields and ensures the password meets basic security criteria.
- **"Remember Me"**: Users can opt to be remembered on subsequent visits, maintaining a smoother experience.
- **Email Confirmation**: After a successful registration, a confirmation email is sent to the user to verify the email address.
- **Error Handling and Success Messages**: The user interface provides meaningful error messages when invalid inputs are detected, and success notifications after a successful registration.
